# CardsGame
This card game is a unique four-player game called Straights. The overall objective of the game is to obtain the least amount of points comparatively to the other players. The player with the least amount of points will win, and this point check will occur when one of the players get 80 or more points.  
  
**Overview**  
The overall structure of my program / implementation of the card game Straights is seen through the combination of the classes Card, Deck, Game, and Player (with Player having a child in the form of Human and Computer classes). The main is then used to implement all of them together to work as needed for the game. The Makefile is responsible for combining and compiling the necessary components / files to create an executable called “straights” which can be used to run the game.
